URP Usage Instructions
This package is created for HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline) by default. However, URP (Universal Render Pipeline) support is also included.

If you wish to use this asset in a URP project, please follow the steps below:

After downloading, the project will open with a default HDRP scene.

If you plan to use URP, first make sure to delete the HDRP folder or any HDRP-related scenes/assets.

Then, go to the URP folder and import the URP.unitypackage into your project.

Alternatively, you can directly import the URP.unitypackage into any other URP project manually.

These steps will prevent conflicts between HDRP and URP assets and ensure a clean import process.
